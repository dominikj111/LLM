Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the problem of computer systems learning from data without being explicitly programmed. The goal is to develop systems that can take data and use it to make predictions or decisions that are useful in some context. The process involves training the system on a large dataset of labeled examples, and then using that dataset to make predictions or decisions on new, unlabeled examples.\n",
